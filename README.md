This project, developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and the Leaflet JavaScript library, 
provides a comprehensive travel planning tool. It allows users to input a list of cities, 
calculates distances between each pair using the RapidAPI Distance API, and determines the optimal route that covers all specified cities. 
The application displays the calculated path, including timings, duration between cities, and distances in kilometers. 
Additionally, it integrates with a hotel API to retrieve and display hotel details for each city. 
The project also estimates the total cost of the entire trip, offering users a complete overview of their travel plans with interactive map visualization provided by Leaflet.
